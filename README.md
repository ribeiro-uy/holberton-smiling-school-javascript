# 0x0F. Build a web app in JavaScript

## :open_file_folder: Specializations - Web Stack programming ― Front-end

In this project, I will finalize the previous project 0x0B by implementing a design with bootstrap and make some parts dynamic with Javascript (JQuery exactly).

I will reuse the final files of 0x0B. Implement a design with bootstrap and update them.

I will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design/Bootstrap/Javascript knowledge I learned previously.

I won’t have a lot of instruction, and I will be free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have fully functional web pages that look the same as the designer file.

Here is the final result:
